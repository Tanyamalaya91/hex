# Hex

Hex is a chatops bot written in Go and is completely configuration driven. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. Hex was started as a way of getting DevOps tasks and feedback into Slack. There are a billion other bots, but we wanted to learn Go, so this was a fun way to learn it and meet our needs. 

Documentation has all moved to the new website [hexbot.io](http://hexbot.io).
