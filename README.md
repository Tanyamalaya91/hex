# Hex

An automation focused bot for doing your sysadmin dirty work.

Hex is a chatops bot written in Go and is completely configuration driven. Contributions are welcome via pull requests. Hex was started as a way of getting DevOps tasks and feedback into Slack. There are a billion other bots, but we wanted to learn Go, so this was a fun way to learn it while trying to make the world a more automated place.
